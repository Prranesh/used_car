Project title: Used car price prediction using Linear Regression

Project description: From the provided two datasets 'train.csv' and 'test.csv'. A linear regreesion model is built from train.csv dataset and the predictions of car price is performed on the test dataset. The primary steps involved are 
1) Data analysis and cleaning
2) Data analysis (univariate and bi-variate)
3) Data scaling
4) Data modelling
5) Model Evaluation
